Here’s a university-style README.md for your mini NLP Resume Matcher project — written in clear, humanized student language. It explains what the project is, how it works, and how to run it — sounding like something you’d genuinely submit with your coursework or demo.

NLP-Based Resume Matcher

Overview

This project is a simple but effective Resume to Job Description (JD) Matching System built using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It allows recruiters or users to input a job requirement (in the form of a sentence, paragraph, or keywords), and the system automatically finds the most relevant resumes from a dataset of candidate profiles.

The core idea behind this project is to move beyond traditional keyword-based matching and instead understand the semantic meaning of the job description and resume content. Using sentence embeddings, the model captures contextual similarity between what a job requires and what a candidate offers.

This prototype demonstrates how NLP can make recruitment smarter, faster, and more accurate.

Project Motivation

Recruiters often have to manually go through hundreds of resumes to find the right candidates.
Conventional systems rely on keyword searches, which can miss relevant candidates who use different phrasing.
For example, a JD requiring “AI Engineer” may miss resumes that say “Machine Learning Developer”.

To solve this, we use semantic similarity — a method that compares the meaning of texts rather than the words alone. This allows for more natural and accurate matching between resumes and job descriptions.

Key Features
	•	Uses Sentence Transformers (SBERT) for semantic text embeddings.
	•	Stores pre-computed embeddings to make querying faster.
	•	Supports hybrid matching, combining semantic and keyword similarity.
	•	Displays top 3 most relevant resumes for a given job description.
	•	Simple Flask web interface for demonstration.
	•	Modular design: one file for embedding generation, another for testing or web demo.

⸻

Technologies and Libraries
	•	Python 3.10+
	•	Flask — for web interface
	•	Sentence-Transformers — for semantic embeddings
	•	scikit-learn — for cosine similarity
	•	YAKE — for keyword extraction
	•	Pandas, NumPy, Pickle — for data handling and caching

How It Works

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Embedding Generator (embedder.py)
	•	Reads all resumes from a CSV file.
	•	Uses a pretrained SBERT model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate numerical embeddings for each resume.
	•	Stores these embeddings in a .pkl file for future use, so they don’t have to be recomputed every time.

2. Resume Matcher (tester.py or webdemo.py)
	•	Takes a job description or query text as input (from CLI or a web form).
	•	Converts the input into an embedding using the same SBERT model.
	•	Computes cosine similarity between the query embedding and all resume embeddings.
	•	Ranks resumes based on similarity scores and shows the top 3 most relevant matches.
	•	Optionally, adds a keyword-based weight using YAKE for extra precision.

Why These NLP Techniques Were Chosen

This project focuses on methods that are university-level but still powerful and practical:

Technique	Purpose	Why It’s Used
Sentence-BERT (SBERT)	Create contextual sentence embeddings	Understands semantic meaning beyond words
Cosine Similarity	Compare vector directions	Simple and efficient for similarity computation
YAKE (Keyword Extraction)	Capture key terms	Enhances matching precision for specific skills
Embedding Caching	Store precomputed vectors	Speeds up matching and allows multiple queries

These tools together strike a balance between accuracy, interpretability, and simplicity, making the project suitable for both academic and real-world demonstrations.

How to Run

Step 1: Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Generate Resume Embeddings

python embedder.py

This reads all resumes, creates embeddings, and saves them as a .pkl file.

Step 3: Run the Web Demo

python webdemo.py

Then open your browser and visit:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

Enter a job description (for example:
“Looking for a data scientist skilled in Python and machine learning.”)
The system will return the top 3 most relevant resumes.

⸻

Dataset

The dataset contains 200 synthetic but realistic resumes representing different fields such as:
	•	Software Development
	•	Data Science and AI
	•	Finance and Accounting
	•	Marketing and Design
	•	Healthcare and Education
	•	Engineering and Law

Each entry is written to resemble real-world resume summaries from diverse professional domains.

⸻

Limitations
	•	The model only compares textual data, not formatted resumes (like full PDFs with layout or images).
	•	It uses general-purpose embeddings and is not fine-tuned on recruitment data.
	•	Keyword weights are manually defined, not learned.
	•	It works best for English-language resumes.

⸻

Future Enhancements
	•	Fine-tune the model on real resume–JD pairs for domain-specific accuracy.
	•	Add support for PDF parsing and full resume uploads.
	•	Build a feedback loop so recruiters can rate matches and improve results over time.
	•	Extend the system to match candidates to candidates (for networking or team matching).
	•	Integrate with a front-end app (e.g., Flutter) as part of the Rizzume ecosystem.

⸻

Conclusion

This mini project demonstrates how modern NLP can be used to enhance traditional recruitment systems.
By using semantic embeddings instead of keyword matching, it brings intelligence and context-awareness to resume screening — helping recruiters find the right candidates faster, and helping candidates get discovered even if they describe their skills differently.

It also serves as a strong foundation for expanding into a larger AI-powered talent-matching platform.
